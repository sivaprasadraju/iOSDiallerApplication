# iOSDiallerApplication
The Problem with current iOS dialer app is that, unlike in other mobile OS, we can't search the name with the help of numpad(0,9).

Provided a list of contacts(Format: First Name, Last Name, Phone, Address), I have created a search functionality for the same. Created the logic in a modular fashion so that we can further extend this feature to create a new iOS caller application.
